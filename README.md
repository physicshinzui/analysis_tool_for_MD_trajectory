#Analysis tool for MD trajectory

This is the program which enable us to analyse MD trajectories.

Present implementations are as follows:

(1) Root mean square displacement 
    *Ca atoms
    *Backbone atoms 

(2) (comming soom) Principal component analysis 
    *PCA with respect to absolute coordinates
    *PCA with respect to distance pairs

(3) (comming soom) Principal axis pf moment of inertia
